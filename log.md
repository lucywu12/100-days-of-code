# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100 Day challenge!

**Thoughts:** Excited to embark on this journey, but I am scared that I won't be able to do it :( Regardless I think I'll learn a lot!

### Day 1: December 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to piece together how GitHub works exactly... especially linking my projects. As long as it works as my daily log though, I can figure out how to link my projects later. I believe I created a local repository? 

**Thoughts**: It's already hard but I'm not going to quit! Sometimes figuring out how things work is more than half the battle...

### Day 2: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
