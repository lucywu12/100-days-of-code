# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 0: December 23, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100 Day challenge!

**Thoughts:** Excited to embark on this journey, but I am scared that I won't be able to do it :( Regardless I think I'll learn a lot!

### Day 1: December 24, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to piece together how GitHub works exactly... especially linking my projects. As long as it works as my daily log though, I can figure out how to link my projects later. I believe I created a local repository? I learned a few things from Mosh about functions vs methods in Python which was exciting and interesting for me

**Thoughts:** It's already hard but I'm not going to quit! Sometimes figuring out how things work is more than half the battle... I have no idea if this is how I should link to files on Github, but this is apparently how it makes sense to me... I will make commits to that original file and date them appropriately so I can look back on my work.

### Day 2: December 25, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Some steady progress! Today I learned about arithmetic rules, if statements, and conditional operators. I've made it to 1:16:24 in Mosh's video (Project: Weight Converter)

**Thoughts**: Everything is still pretty easy thus far, but I like Python. It's cute :) and definitely much easier to tackle than other things I've tried before. Still, I'm getting a lot of joy from listening to Mosh and appreciating the little things. Being able to code the tiny/easy projects he explains in the video without too much difficulty is gratifying, and it shows how much attempting to learn to code in the past helps with learning future languages/intuitive thinking, even if I didn't "master" previous languages (or stick with them...)

We did other things today, but here's the last thing I left off with:

### Day 3: December 26, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Not too much time to code but I made a small dent. Today I learned about While Loops (which function exactly how I remember them). I also made the Weight Calculator from scratch and then compared with Mosh's solution. Now I've made it to 1:30:58 in Mosh's video (Project: Car Game)

**Thoughts**: The one tricky thing I find with using Python are the colons : especially after loops and statements! I was nearly bamboozled... until I remembered. Also, I got a little better at converting strings into different types (although I don't really enjoy that...) Today's lesson on loops brought back fond memories of when I first learned loops for Java over the summer :)

### Day 4: December 27, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I was a little tired today and procrastinated too much (haha) so I did a small project, the Car Game. Now I'm up to 1:41:55 in Mosh's video (Project: For Loops)

**Thoughts**: It was a little confusing but I got most of the way there. The hardest part about coding is the logical thinking and then using this strange language to help get you there.

### Day 5: December 28, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I relearned for loops again (very fun now that I actually understand how to use them properly) and created a shopping cart calculator. Really tired, but now I'm up to 1:47:55 in Mosh's video (Project: Nested Loops)

**Thoughts**: There are definitely many moments where I have a feeling of 'I can't do this' but I think my intutition is really pulling me through. This was an 'easy' calculator to create, but I still had a moment where I thought I wouldn't be able to do it and I would have to look at the solution prematurely. I'm glad I persevered though. :)

### Day 6: December 29, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Nested Loops (fun but need some more practice) and Lists. I'm up to 2:01:55 in Mosh's video (Project: 2D Lists)

**Thoughts**: This was really fun but I was sad I couldn't solve Mosh's X printing exercise without looking at the solution :( For the greatest number calculator, my thinking was correct but I didn't quite execute it well enough...

### Day 7: December 30, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about 2D Lists and their methods. I'm up to 2:13:34 in Mosh's video (Project: Tuples)

**Thoughts**: Today's exercise was ok up until I realized that for some reason my program didn't quite work the way I wanted it to... strange but I guess that's how it is sometimes. I also need to start coding earlier in the day because this is not working well.

### Day 8: December 31, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Tuples and Unpacking them. I'm up to 2:18:32 in Mosh's video (Project: Dictionaries)

**Thoughts**: Today I was really hungry so I cut my programming session short (haha). Learning about tuples was a new and interesting experience for me however! And unpacking was so cool. Looking forward to a new year full of coding!

### Day 9: January 2, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Dictionaries. I'm up to 2:26:32 in Mosh's video (Project: Emoji Converter)

**Thoughts**: Really exciting things today!
