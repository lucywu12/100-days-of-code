# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 0: December 23, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100 Day challenge!

**Thoughts:** Excited to embark on this journey, but I am scared that I won't be able to do it :( Regardless I think I'll learn a lot!

### Day 1: December 24, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to piece together how GitHub works exactly... especially linking my projects. As long as it works as my daily log though, I can figure out how to link my projects later. I believe I created a local repository? I learned a few things from Mosh about functions vs methods in Python which was exciting and interesting for me

**Thoughts:** It's already hard but I'm not going to quit! Sometimes figuring out how things work is more than half the battle... I have no idea if this is how I should link to files on Github, but this is apparently how it makes sense to me... I will make commits to that original file and date them appropriately so I can look back on my work.

### Day 2: December 25, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Some steady progress! Today I learned about arithmetic rules, if statements, and conditional operators. I've made it to 1:16:24 in Mosh's video (Project: Weight Converter)

**Thoughts**: Everything is still pretty easy thus far, but I like Python. It's cute :) and definitely much easier to tackle than other things I've tried before. Still, I'm getting a lot of joy from listening to Mosh and appreciating the little things. Being able to code the tiny/easy projects he explains in the video without too much difficulty is gratifying, and it shows how much attempting to learn to code in the past helps with learning future languages/intuitive thinking, even if I didn't "master" previous languages (or stick with them...)

We did other things today, but here's the last thing I left off with:

### Day 3: December 26, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Not too much time to code but I made a small dent. Today I learned about While Loops (which function exactly how I remember them). I also made the Weight Calculator from scratch and then compared with Mosh's solution. Now I've made it to 1:30:58 in Mosh's video (Project: Car Game)

**Thoughts**: The one tricky thing I find with using Python are the colons : especially after loops and statements! I was nearly bamboozled... until I remembered. Also, I got a little better at converting strings into different types (although I don't really enjoy that...) Today's lesson on loops brought back fond memories of when I first learned loops for Java over the summer :)

### Day 4: December 27, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I was a little tired today and procrastinated too much (haha) so I did a small project, the Car Game. Now I'm up to 1:41:55 in Mosh's video (Project: For Loops)

**Thoughts**: It was a little confusing but I got most of the way there. The hardest part about coding is the logical thinking and then using this strange language to help get you there.

### Day 5: December 28, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I relearned for loops again (very fun now that I actually understand how to use them properly) and created a shopping cart calculator. Really tired, but now I'm up to 1:47:55 in Mosh's video (Project: Nested Loops)

**Thoughts**: There are definitely many moments where I have a feeling of 'I can't do this' but I think my intutition is really pulling me through. This was an 'easy' calculator to create, but I still had a moment where I thought I wouldn't be able to do it and I would have to look at the solution prematurely. I'm glad I persevered though. :)

### Day 6: December 29, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Nested Loops (fun but need some more practice) and Lists. I'm up to 2:01:55 in Mosh's video (Project: 2D Lists)

**Thoughts**: This was really fun but I was sad I couldn't solve Mosh's X printing exercise without looking at the solution :( For the greatest number calculator, my thinking was correct but I didn't quite execute it well enough...

### Day 7: December 30, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about 2D Lists and their methods. I'm up to 2:13:34 in Mosh's video (Project: Tuples)

**Thoughts**: Today's exercise was ok up until I realized that for some reason my program didn't quite work the way I wanted it to... strange but I guess that's how it is sometimes. I also need to start coding earlier in the day because this is not working well.

### Day 8: December 31, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Tuples and Unpacking them. I'm up to 2:18:32 in Mosh's video (Project: Dictionaries)

**Thoughts**: Today I was really hungry so I cut my programming session short (haha). Learning about tuples was a new and interesting experience for me however! And unpacking was so cool. Looking forward to a new year full of coding!

### Day 9: January 2, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Dictionaries. I'm up to 2:26:32 in Mosh's video (Project: Emoji Converter)

**Thoughts**: Sadly I had to skip yesterday because I was so tired :(. However, I came back to learning today! I should learn to never underestimate the value of an empty string. I was on the right track today, it was just a little confusing as to how to create and use the dictionary but I'm sure I'll pick it up with a little more practice.

**Link(s) to work**:
[1/2 Dictionaries](https://github.com/lucywu12/100-days-of-code/blob/master/app.py)


### Day 10: January 3, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to make an Emoji Converter! I'm up to 2:30:41 in Mosh's video (Project: Functions)

**Thoughts**: Today's project was very fun! I now better understand how to use dictionaries. Thought it's been really difficult to make time to code (*procrastination*) I am still proud of making it this far and doing a little every day. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have a little more time.

### Day 11: January 4, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Functions and Parameters! I'm up to 2:39:35 in Mosh's video (Project: Keyword Arguments)

**Thoughts**: A little too tired still, but making some progress. I have to say either 1. Mosh is a better teacher or 2. Python is really easy in comparison to some of the other languages I attempted to learn before because honestly this isn't too bad. I know it's a beginners course but it still feels nice that this isn't too much of a struggle to pick up and is pretty enjoyable and interesting to watch work.

### Day 12: January 5, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more on Functions and their properties! I'm up to 2:53:55 in Mosh's video (Project: Exceptions)

**Thoughts**: Things are starting to get a little more complex now... everything still makes sense but it's definitely a lot harder than before. Still having fun and looking forward to procrastinating less and coding more!

### Day 13: January 6, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to make my own classes and debug! I'm up to 3:08:00 in Mosh's video (Project: Constructors)

**Thoughts**: Wow learning how to actually make classes was SUPER cool! Looking forward to coding when less sleep deprived :)

### Day 14: January 7, 2020, Thursrday

**Today's Progress**: Yay! Two week mark! Today I learned how to create Constructors and use them with Classes! I'm up to 3:14:54 in Mosh's video (Project: Inheritance)

**Thoughts**: Still really sleepy... but pushing through! Classes are a bit confusing for me, I see what it does but doen't quite have the techinques and specifics of it all down yet.

### Day 15: January 8, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Yay! Two week mark! Today I learned about Inheritance and Modules! I'm up to 3:30:28 in Mosh's video (Project: Packages)

**Thoughts**: Today's lesson was super fun! I even got the exercise except the colon...

### Day 16: January 9, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about importing packages! I'm up to 3:38:36 in Mosh's video (Project: Generating Random Values)

**Thoughts**: I didn't do anything too crazy today, but I thought this would be nice to just take a small break. Today's lesson made a lot of sense, and I hope to use the package feature in the future! (Importing packages and the structure of code makes a lot more sense to me in general now.)

### Day 17: January 11, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about random values! I'm up to 3:44:36 in Mosh's video (Project: Working with Directories)

**Thoughts**: I didn't do anything too crazy today, but I thought this would be nice to just take a small break. Today's lesson made a lot of sense, and I hope to use the package feature in the future! (Importing packages and the structure of code makes a lot more sense to me in general now.)
